quoteChar
	"In a Unix shell, this character is used to delimit chunks of text which should not
	be expanded with wildcards or shell variables. In a Smalltalk compiler, this character
	delimits a String. ShellSyntax interprets it as a delimiter for a  literal string which
	should not be expanded or interpreted in any way."
